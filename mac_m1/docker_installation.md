## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 **64-bit**

## 1. Install using the Apt repository

Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

Set up Docker's Apt repository.

### 1.1. Add Docker's official GPG key
  
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

### 1.2. Add the repository to Apt sources
  
  ```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

### 1.3. Install Docker Engine

To install the latest version, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image.

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.

You have now successfully installed and started Docker Engine.

## 2. Linux post-installation steps for Docker Engine

These are some optional steps to take after installing Docker Engine on Ubuntu 22.04.

### 2.1. Manage Docker as a non-root user

To run Docker commands without sudo, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it.

To create the docker group and add your user:

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

To apply the new group membership, log out of the server and back in, or type the following:

```bash
newgrp docker
```

Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo.

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

## 3. Next steps

To install VS Code and the Remote - Containers extension to use Docker with VS Code, follow the [instructions](/mac_m1/vscode_docker.md)
